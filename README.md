## Next.js connected to Storyblok

*Next.js boilerplate that is already connected to Storyblok API.

Create a new space and retrieve your preview token for that Space. Add the token to your Storyblok client in storyblok.js as the accessToken directly or from an .env file. In this boilerplate I will add my token to '.env.example', but be sure to remove '.example' if you dont want your key to be visible to everyone.

```bash
npm run dev
